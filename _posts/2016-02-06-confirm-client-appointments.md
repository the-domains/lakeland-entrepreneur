Confirm Appointments, ALWAYS
![Don't lose time like this guy.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6a399a1e-8a8f-4b42-8cdd-2c00c2176274.gif)

I recently drove an hour to an appointment. Each way.

This is rare for today's connected world. So, I usually reserve this for times I feel that flesh-and-blood, person-to-person, analogue connections are important.

When I showed up, the critical party was not there.

So, my meeting lasted all of 27 minutes.

On the hour-long drive back to my office, I kicked myself over and over for not verifying the appointment.

_"With just a 3 minute phone call,"_ the link of thinking goes, _"I could have verified all would (or would not) be there."_

Investing__the time is rarely wasted. Clients feel appreciated. But the cost of the trip goes through the roof, let along the opportunity cost. (My coaching goes for $120 an hour.)

Simply call to verify your client appointments. You will be glad you did.
