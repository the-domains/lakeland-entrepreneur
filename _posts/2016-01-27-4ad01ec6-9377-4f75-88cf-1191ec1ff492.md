Brianna Burton, a local social butterfly, just came by to announce that she is making huge progress.

For a small business owner, progress simply means that they have attained some level of clarity.

For emerging entrepreneur Brianna Burton, that means saying '_No' _to web design.

_"I have just come to realize that it is not my strength and I do not want it to be my strength,"_ she recently told me.

_"How does that make you feel?"_ I asked.

_"FREE! I feel freed up to pursue my passion; social media marketing."_

**THE ENTREPRENEURIAL LESSON**

The take-away for you should be two-fold.

First, remember this: _Decisions determine Destiny_. Once you make a decision, you are freed up to move forward.

The second lesson is this: _we are defined by what we say 'no' to_. Find something that you have been doing but is not core to your business and simply cut it.

That will free you up to focus on making your core business great. BAM!
